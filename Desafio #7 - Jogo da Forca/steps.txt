# Importar o m√≥dulo random, palavras e arte.

# TODO-2 - Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

# TODO-3 - Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word. Print "Right" if it
#  is, "Wrong" if it's not.

# TODO-4: Create a "placeholder" with the same number of blanks as the chosen_word

# TODO-5: Create a "display" that puts the guess letter in the right positions and _ in the rest of the string.

# TODO-6
# Use a while loop to let the user guess again.
# The loop should only stop once the user has guessed all the letters in the chosen_word.
# At that point display has no more blanks ("_"). Then you can tell the user they've won.

# TODO-7
# Update the for loop so that previous guesses are added to the display String.
# At the moment, when the user makes a new guess, the previous guess gets replaced by a "_". We need to fix that by updating the for loop.

# #TODO-8:
# Create a variable called tries to keep track of the number of tries left.
# Set tries to equal 

#  TODO-9:
# If guess is not a letter in the chosen_word, Then reduce lives by 1.
# If lives goes down to 0 then the game should end, and it should print "You lose."0.

# TODO-10:
# print the ASCII art from the list stages that corresponds to the current number of lives the user has remaining.

# TODO-11:
# Update the word list to use the word_list from hangman_words.py
# 
# Update the code to use the stages from the file hangman_art.py
# 
# Import the logo from hangman_art.py and print it at the start of the game.

# TODO-12:
# If the user has entered a letter they've already guessed, print the letter and let them know.
# We should not deduct a life for this.
# e.g. You've already guessed b

#TODO-13:
# If the letter is not in the chosen_word, print out the letter and let them know it's not in the word.
# e.g. You guessed d, that's not in the word. You lose a life.

# TODO-14:
# Update the code below to tell the user how many lives they have left. print("****************************<???>/6 LIVES LEFT****************************")

# TODO 15:
# Update the print statement to give the user the correct word they were trying to guess.
# e.g. IT WAS <Correct Word>! YOU LOSE
